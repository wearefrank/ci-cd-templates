# 1. Decouple functional core of an action into platform independent scripts
**Date:** 22-10-2024

## Status
Proposed

## Context
GitHub Actions specific syntax limits sharing across different ci-cd platforms. 
The functional core of an action usually is or can be contained in one or more scripts of somesort.

## Decision
Decouple the functional core of an action into platform independent scripts.
The platform specific implementations of an action should execute the platform independent script.

## Consequences
Existing actions should be refactored. Care should be taken that the platform specific implementation executes the same version of the script as the action.
